a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event?

An arrival event needs to generate a new arrival event to ensure the simulation continues to reflect the ongoing nature of the system. In real-world scenarios like a call center, customers keep arriving over time. By scheduling the next arrival when one occurs, the simulation maintains a realistic flow of events and avoids stopping prematurely. This also helps model predictable patterns (e.g., every 3 minutes) or incorporate randomness if needed.

b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service (of a single service point)?

When a service starts at a single service point, it should generate a completion event (a B-type event). This event marks the end of the service and allows the simulation to update the system state, such as freeing up the operator and possibly triggering the next conditional event (like starting service for the next customer in queue).
